WIP Personal Portfolio.

Github Copilot was used to help implement javascript assets and advanced inline html features like the alerts when clicking on 'resume' and 'github' buttons within the navigation bar. To view the original version, where github co-pilot was not used, please click [here.(https://github.com/dpt82/Rodent-Violations-at-NYC-Schools-Cafeterias)] This webpage was formerly used as a webpage to display a data story I covered on rodent and roach violations during inspections by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in New York City School Cafeterias. That story will be included in this portfolio, but is also available in a seperate repository found here.
