WIP Personal Portfolio. This webpage was formerly used as a webpage to display a data story I covered on rodent and roach violations during inspections by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in New York City School Cafeterias. That story will be included in this portfolio, but is also available in a seperate repository found [here](urhttps://github.com/dpt82/Rodent-Violations-at-NYC-Schools-Cafeteriasl).
