                        <p>While sex work has become more socially acceptable, some Queens residents say the presence of sex workers along Roosevelt Avenue has made it increasingly difficult to carry out even the simplest aspects of daily life.</p>
                        <p>That’s why, for many residents, the city’s ongoing effort to crack down on illegal business activities in the area is a welcomed response. But sex workers and advocates say the initiative will target the community's most vulnerable members, including immigrants, transgender individuals and those who engage in street vending or sex work for survival.</p>
                        <p>“There's so many examples of how policing only makes sex work more dangerous,” said Jared Trujillo, a co-leader of the pro-sex trade coalition Decrim NY. “Particularly in Queens, where the policing of sex work has had this really, incredibly nefarious, very recent past.”</p>
                
            <h3>What is Operation Restore Roosevelt?</h3> 
                <p>Trujillo was referring to the 2018 indictment of several officers in NYPD’s ​​Vice Enforcement Division, or “vice squad,” which is tasked with policing “quality-of-life” work such as consensual sex work and gambling. The officers were indicted for allegedly running a complex prostitution ring and gambling operation. </p>
                <p>“These are people who are supposed to be helping sex workers, who are actually weaponizing their badges to exploit folks, to take money from folks, and to rape people,” said Trujillo.</p>
                <p>That’s why Trujillo was alarmed by Mayor Eric Adams’ announcement in October that his administration would launch Operation Restore Roosevelt, a three-month crackdown on illegal business activities along a 30-block stretch of Roosevelt Avenue. </p> 
                <p>The announcement fell on the heels of a monthslong campaign by some community members to improve the quality of life in the Elmhurst, Corona and Jackson Heights neighborhoods of Queens, which had the highest arrest rates for charges related sex work in 2024, according to the latest batch of <a style="text-decoration: solid;" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc">NYPD arrest data.</a> </p>
            <div id ="map-container"> 
                    <div id = "map_hed"></div>
                    <div id = "map_button"></div>
                  <div id="map"><script src="scripts/map.js"></script> </div>
                  <div id ="map_byline"></div>
             </div> 
              <p>“This road should be the pride of our city, but for too long it has been plagued by persistent public safety and quality-of-life issues,” Adams said during the press conference where he first made the announcement. “We won’t allow this to continue any longer.”</p>
      
                <p>The multi-agency operation gives the NYPD leverage to address criminal offenses, including sex work, retail theft, the sale of stolen goods and the operation of illegal businesses, such as brothels and unlicensed street vending.</p>
                <p>The police department may also make referrals to other city agencies on behalf of individuals who officers identify as needing assistance, which may include housing or medical care.</p>
                <p>Though the operation is supposed to mitigate illegal business activities, business owner Yamuna Shreshta said that it has produced unfavorable outcomes for her restaurant Nepali Bhanchha Ghar. Drivers who deliver groceries to her restaurant have been receiving street parking violation tickets more often, she said. </p>
                <p>“When the business is on the peak, we cannot leave the customer, go and get the groceries,” said Neha Rana, an employee at the restaurant who translated for Shreshta. “So [by] that time, they place a ticket.” </p>

                <p>For Alexis Aguilar, the operation has had an opposite effect on his clothing store A & K Sports. Instead of actually entering the store, he said, potential customers sometimes left with the sex workers soliciting outside. At other times, families and people with children didn’t approach his business because they saw sex workers near the store, he said. </p>
                <p>“Right now it has improved a little because, as they say, the police have been around more,” he said.</p>
                <p>But fewer sex workers on the street could also mean that the trade is being forced further underground, said Trujillo. When sex workers are pushed into more precarious work settings, it makes it more difficult for them to screen clients and negotiate using protection, he said.</p>
                <p>The mayor’s office and supporters of Operation Restore Roosevelt have also claimed that the operation will decrease the amount of sex trafficking in the area. But City Council Member Tiffany Caban, whose district covers portions of where Operation Restore Roosevelt is taking place, said that engaging sex workers rather than criminalizing their work would help mitigate sex trafficking.</p>
                <p>“We can't really target it effectively because the people who you rely on to be able to access those traffickers are the very people that you're criminalizing who aren't going to be inclined to cooperate,” she said.  </p>
            
            <h3>A long history of sex work in Queens</h3>
                <p>When a friend introduced Victoria Von Blaque to sex work, the then-college student became instantly intrigued. She had already experienced workplace discrimination due to her gender identity as a Black trans woman. And despite having a close relationship with her mother, Von Blaque sought to move out so that she could complete her gender transition in comfort.  </p>
                <p>“I think sex work chose me,” she said. </p>
                <p>While Von Blaque has mainly engaged in digital sex work since then, as a newcomer to the trade, she frequented Roosevelt Avenue and occasionally found clients there. But the city’s latest law enforcement initiative has threatened the sense of safety and community that the street once provided to her, she said.</p>
                <p>“This area was never unsafe for marginalized communities,” Von Blaque said.</p>
                <p>Queens’ sex trade industry took root in the borough decades ago and has remained an ever-present part of the community since, particularly in the borough’s Flushing and Jackson Heights neighborhoods. </p>
                <p>Asian and Latino residents make up over half of the population in these neighborhoods, respectively. Most residents in these neighborhoods are also immigrants. Yves Tong Nguyen, a cultural worker at the Flushing-based advocacy group Red Canary Song, said that though she doesn’t believe recent migration to the city has caused an uptick in sex work, the industry is still largely driven by residents’ socio-economic needs.</p>
                <p>“Migrants in the past [have] come here because they are from destabilized countries where they've been dispossessed from land, from resources, opportunities,” she said. “Sex work offers an opportunity for people to make more money more quickly when they don't have as many opportunities.”</p>
            <div id="bar_container">
                <script src ="scripts/bar_chart.js"></script>
            </div>
                <p>The same could be applied to LGBT individuals who enter the trade, said Trujillo. While some are coerced into the profession, or choose to do it because they see it as a viable career path, “there's the reason that most people do it, [which is] circumstance,” he said. “Meaning, ‘I'm a trans Latina person. I am excluded from other jobs because of who I am.’”</p>
                <p>New York State law defines prostitution, or sex work, as the act of engaging in sex in exchange for a fee, a crime punishable by up to three months in jail. Punishment for someone who patronizes a sex worker, on the other hand, ranges from one year in jail to life in prison.</p>   
                <p>Enforcement of these laws became acutely significant during the nineties. Between 1991 and 1995, more than 150 brothels had been shut down and over 1,000 people were arrested for sex trade-related activity in the borough, former executive assistant to the district attorney for special prosecutions Jesse Sligh told the New York Daily News in 1995.</p>
                <p>And when the use of stop-and-frisk by law enforcement was still in full effect, trans women and LGBT individuals in Jackson Heights were nearly twice as likely to be stopped as compared non-LGBT residents, according to a 2012 report published by Make the Road New York. </p>
                <p>Arrests for all sex work-related offenses have since dropped dramatically. About 250 arrests have been made this year, according to NYPD data, representing a 45% decrease in the number of annual sex work-related arrests as compared to just five years ago. </p>
            <div id="container">
                <script src ="scripts/line_chart.js"></script>
                <script src="scripts/observer.js"></script>
            </div>
                <p>Queens residents have also historically come together to mitigate sex work in the area, whether it be independently or in collaboration with city and state officials. </p>
                <p>The Quality of Life Coalition, for example, conducted a campaign in 1995 to take down brothels in Flushing. The coalition – made up of community groups, legislators and faith leaders – credited itself with the takedown of at least twelve brothels. </p>
                <p>Over the past few months, a similar grassroots organization called Let’s Improve Roosevelt Ave has taken root in the borough. The organization has brought hundreds of community members together to rally against acts that they say destroy Queens’ quality of life. </p>
            <h3>What’s next for Roosevelt Avenue</h3>
                <p>With a 90-day expiration date, Operation Restore Roosevelt will likely end sometime in mid-January. But efforts to deport migrants may still have an impact on the street, particularly for sex workers who may be undocumented. </p>
                <p>While the city’s Democratic mayor has never explicitly spoken about deporting sex workers, he recently announced that he had reached out to future border czar Tom Homan about ways to deport migrants who have committed crimes. </p>
                <p>“Those who are here committing crimes – robberies, shooting at police officers, raping innocent people – have been a harm to our country,” he said at a press conference in early December. “I want to sit down and hear the plan on how we’re going to address them.”</p>
                <p>City Council Member Tiffany Caban, who previously ran for Queens district attorney on a campaign that opposed prosecuting crimes related to the sex trades, said “people are terrified.”</p>
                <p>“We are already in dire straits because of the conditions that exist under this administration, and it's going to get worse under this presidency,” she said. </p>
                <p>Caban is the sponsor of a pro-sex work bill currently before the Committee on Civil and Human Rights. The bill, if passed, would prohibit housing discrimination and child services intervention based solely on a person’s status as a sex worker. It would also create a sex worker opportunity program, which would enable the Mayor’s Office of Equity and Social Justice to provide grants to community organizations that work directly with sex workers. </p>
                <p>“We're asking people to make really hard, difficult choices,” Caban said in reference to why people choose to engage in sex work. “And as a government, our responsibility is to create the conditions where every single person can thrive, not punish people for our own governmental systemic failures.”</p>
