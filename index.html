					<h3>Rodents in Schools?</h3>	

							This comes amidst the 1-year anniversary of Mayor Adams “War on Rats” which aims to reduce the rodent population across NYC. The anti-rodent policy included new rules mandating restaurants and businesses to put their trash in sealed bins instead of leaving trash bags out on their storefront. Despite these efforts, rodent sightings at NYC schools during cafeteria inspections remain high. Brooklyn schools had the highest rates of rodent and roach violations as of November 27, according to inspection data.
